This repo is a simple website that I made for my girlfriend.

I've provided the source code so that anyone can see how I made it, if they would like. 

I chose a Next.js app just because integration with Vercel's services was easier. I can utilize the free tier since the website is static. This may be overengineered, but I'm fine with that.

If you have any questions or wanna contribute to the domain cost fees(lol), message me on twitter. It's on this github.
